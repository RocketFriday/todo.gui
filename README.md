y- a task waiting to be verified

x- a completed task


Some comments:
- I looped through tasks manually because I liked seeing it unload and load them in.

- Upload and Download btns don't do anything, it was to a localhost server I had but disabled the buttons after I turned off my server. (for a while I would download the updated text file on my phone and add things I forgot and then remembered only after getting in bed to sleep)

- You update the list (any list) by double clicking the 'Tasks' or 'Fixed' category.

- I have it minimized to tray to be out of the way unless wanted/needed. I don't use it windowed or otherwise so I removed the ui buttons in the build.

- Escape key quits the entire application.
